This list is subject to change, of course, but should be kept in order of first
to last thing(s) to do.

Some tasks or group of tasks have a number, 1-3, rating the expected difficulty
of the task, 1 being the lowest (easy) and 3 being the highest (difficult).
These are also expected to be revised as time goes on and different tasks get
accomplished.
