TODO.txt -- bugreport to-do list

CHORES:

 Here are some potential refactorings:

 -comments in .dump dictate expectations, remove expectations from
 systemTestList.txt
 
 -extract template method(s) from emulateOpcode similar switch statements
 
 -adding to a pointer with only one element should
 InvalidOperationException
 
 -GetNewBuffer should be on AbstractBuffer and return AbstactBuffer;
 tests that use it should move to AbstractBufferTests
 
 -unify duplicative hex switch statements by introducing a private struct
 
 -make operator effect, stack effect, etc a parameter to emulateOpcode

STORIES:

This list is subject to change, of course, but should be kept in order of first
to last thing(s) to do.

Some tasks or group of tasks have a number, 1-3, rating the expected difficulty
of the task, 1 being the lowest (easy) and 3 being the highest (difficult).
These are also expected to be revised as time goes on and different tasks get
accomplished.
